    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a multiskilled, digital all-rounder living in Norwich, England. I moved into a full time digital role in 2005.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I have been incredibly lucky to work in lots of areas in the digital world with some brilliant people; from small independent startups to super cool design houses, through to national and global corporates on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>I have worked predominantly in front-end web development but have strong creative digital design skills and a passion for email development.</p>
    <p>In 2020 I started to work with social media marketing, creating exciting strategies and managing content for freelance clients.</p>
    <p>I also became qualified as a Certified Email Design Practitioner with Litmus.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m fully versed in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and have further experience with AfterEffects and Premiere for animations and video editing. I like to use Adobe XD for UI design and prototyping and have some experience using Sketch.</p>
    <p>I code responsively using HTML5, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I have extensively worked with WordPress and front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.</p>
    <p>I have further, varying levels of experience with lots of different tools and languages used in the digital and web development world.</p>

    <h3>What I am doing now</h3>
    <p>I spent 2020 freelancing and helping local small businesses with their digital presence. This included everything from logos and branding, website design and build, social media management, illustrations and the creation of bespoke vinyl stickers.</p>
